# The Unique Game

The Unique Game is a Django powered Single Page Application (SPA) where the aim of the user is to type a word that is unique on the platform. That is, the word has not been typed on the platform previously by a user before.

If you type a unique word, you get a cookie! Else, you get a count of the number of times that word has been typed before you on the platform.

The game, by its nature gets incrementally difficult as more and more new words are fed to the system by the users.
